# GitOps: Principles, Benefits, and Applications

## Introduction
GitOps is a software development and operations practice that uses Git as the source of truth for managing infrastructure and deployment. It provides a framework that allows for version control, automation, continuous delivery, and collaboration. This report will explore the principles, benefits, and applications of DevOps, specifically why GitOps is relevant in modern software development.

## Background
Software infrastructure historically required specialized teams to do largely manual work to set up. This approach is not compatible with the demands of today's infrastructure, which needs to be elastic and fast to effectively manage cloud resources. Some teams may deploy code to production hundreds of times per day, and the infrastructure must accommodate this. Automation is essential, relying on methods such as **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **Merge Requests (MRs)**, and **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**.

## Core Principles of GitOps
GitOps is not a single product, and the best way to apply it varies with the needs and goals of the development team. The three core components of GitOps are **Infrastructure as Code**, **Merge Requests**, and **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery**.

### Infrastructure as Code
- GitOps uses a git repository as the source of truth for the infrastructure. Git keeps track of all changes made to files in a project. Infrastructure as Code is the practice of storing all the infrastructure configuration as code, so that it can be set up and automated.

### Merge Requests
- All updates to the infrastructure are made through merge requests, or pull requests. These are documents where teams collaborate on changes via reviews and comments. Changes, or merges, are only made after the requests have been formally approved by team members. Merge requests then serve as an audit log of all the changes made throughout development.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- GitOps automates infrastructure updates using a Git workflow. When new code is merged, or the workflow is otherwise run, the CI/CD pipeline builds the infrastructure according to the changes. Any changes not in the workflow are overwritten, meaning the infrastructure can always be reverted to a set definition. 

## How GitOps Works
GitOps works through workflows, a systematic and version-controlled approach to infrastructure and application management. It treats your system operations with the same care you would with your main codebase. Changes to infrastructure are made through MRs, ensuring changes are kept track of and reviewed. These workflows are consistent and reproducible, and enable high velocity collaboration and development among team members. 

### Key Components of a GitOps Workflow
1. A git repository that acts as the source of truth for both the application and it's configuration
2. A continuous delivery pipeline that automates the processes of building, testing, and deploying the application.
3. An application deployment tool that deploys the application and manages its resources.
4. A system to monitor the application's health and performance, providing actionable feedback.

## Benefits of GitOps
GitOps offers numerous advantages, including:

- **Auditability**: Version control and change history.
- **Automation**: Reduced manual interventions.
- **Consistency**: Uniform environments across development, staging, and production.
- **Resilience**: Rapid rollbacks and recovery from failures.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined development processes.
- **Security**: Logs and roles are kept.
- **Developer Experience**: Simple and easy to use.
- **Reduced Costs**: No need for specialized infrastructure teams.
- **Faster Deployments**: Automated workflows as code.
- **Greater Collaboration**: A single source of truth.

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite its benefits, GitOps has some challenges:

- **Requires Discipline**: Teams need to be trained to do things correctly and to write everything down, no matter how small the change.

- **Slower Individual Changes**: Changes are approved by a "committee", which is time consuming compared to quick, manual changes.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GitOps is a great way to streamline secure software development and minimize human error. It automates the infrastructure as code so that it can be easily built and reproduced. All changes need to be reviewed by a team, causing better collaboration and improved security. Deployment is automated so that changes are automatically built into the infrastructure. The application is constantly monitored for cases of failure. In my time learning about software development, I have increasingly seen the benefits of of GitOps, and it's the system that I would always use when developing with a team.

### Call to Action
If you don't yet understand the benefits of GitOps, try it out, and you might see many of the annoyances and failures of collaboration go away.
